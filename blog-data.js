    body: "<p>Scoping an MVP is one of the hardest parts of building a product. Here’s how we do it at Standen so you can ship fast without burning budget.</p><p><strong>Start with the one thing that matters.</strong> Strip everything back to the single outcome that proves the idea. If you can’t describe it in one sentence, narrow it further.</p><p><strong>Fix time and budget, then scope.</strong> We work to fixed timelines (often 2–4 weeks for an MVP). Once time and budget are set, we fit scope to that box — not the other way around.</p><p><strong>No “nice to haves” in v1.</strong> Every feature has to answer: “Do we need this to validate the idea?” If not, it goes on the roadmap for later.</p><p>Get in touch if you want to turn your idea into a scoped, shippable MVP.</p>"

    body: "<p>Not every problem needs custom software — but some do. Here’s how we help clients decide.</p><p><strong>Use SaaS when:</strong> The problem is well understood, there are mature products, and your differentiators aren’t in the tool itself. You’ll move faster and cheaper.</p><p><strong>Build custom when:</strong> Your workflow is unique, you’re competing on product, or you need deep integration with your own systems. Off-the-shelf will hold you back.</p><p><strong>Hybrid is common.</strong> Many clients use SaaS for marketing, CRM, and ops, and custom software for the core product or internal tools. We help you draw the line.</p><p>Need a view on your situation? <a href=\"index.html#contact\">Tell us what you’re trying to do</a> and we’ll give you an honest take.</p>"

    body: "<p>“Fast” and “quality” don’t have to be opposites. Here’s how we balance speed and craft.</p><p><strong>Stack choices matter.</strong> We use proven stacks (e.g. React, Node, modern hosting) so we’re not experimenting on your dime. That speeds delivery and keeps maintenance predictable.</p><p><strong>Scope stays tight.</strong> The biggest risk to quality is scope creep. We lock scope at kickoff and treat new ideas as “next phase” unless they’re essential to v1.</p><p><strong>You see progress every step.</strong> Short cycles and regular demos mean you can steer early. Nothing gets built in a black box.</p><p>If you want to move fast without the usual trade-offs, <a href=\"index.html#contact\">start a project</a>.</p>"
